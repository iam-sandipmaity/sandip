summary: "Why I chose privacy over convenience and the privacy-focused software stack that powers my digital life - from search engines to email, VPN, and beyond."

In an era where data is the new oil, every click, search, and email is being tracked, analyzed, and monetized. I made a conscious decision to prioritize **privacy over convenience**, and it's one of the best choices I've made for my digital well-being.

## Why Privacy Matters to Me

### The Wake-Up Call

A few years ago, I realized that "free" services aren't actually free—**I was the product**. My data was being:
- Sold to advertisers
- Used to build psychological profiles
- Shared with third parties without my knowledge
- Stored indefinitely on servers I couldn't control

### The Cost of Convenience

Big Tech companies offer incredibly convenient services, but at what cost?
- **Google** knows more about you than your closest friends
- **Facebook/Meta** tracks you across the web, even when you're not logged in
- **Microsoft** collects telemetry data from Windows
- **Amazon** monitors your shopping habits and listening patterns

### My Privacy Philosophy

I believe in:
- ✅ **Data ownership** - My data belongs to me
- ✅ **Transparency** - I should know what's collected and why
- ✅ **Encryption** - End-to-end encryption should be standard
- ✅ **Open source** - Code should be auditable
- ✅ **Minimal data collection** - Collect only what's necessary
