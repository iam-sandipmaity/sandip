## Important Disclaimer
MFTracker **is not** a performance tracker showing historical returns. It provides **hypothetical analysis** based on market capitalisation, sector exposure, and investment themes, focusing on portfolio structure rather than past performance.

---

## How to Use MFTracker Effectively
1. **Prepare your data** – gather fund names, dates, amounts in CSV/JSON or use OCR.
2. **Load your portfolio** – the tool flags issues like overlapping holdings or misaligned risk profiles.
3. **Run the MF Calculator** – see future projections, including step‑up and inflation adjustments.
4. **Check the Smart Rebalancer** – get recommendations tailored to your risk profile.
5. **Export and monitor** – download PDF/CSV reports and revisit the tool quarterly or after major market moves.

---

## Relevance in Today’s Investing Landscape
- Many investors adopt a “set‑and‑forget” approach; MFTracker encourages active health checks.
- Detects **overlapping holdings** and **theme concentration** that can dilute diversification.
- Inflation‑adjusted projections promote real‑return thinking.
- Built‑in rebalancing nudges users toward a best‑practice portfolio maintenance habit.
- Client‑side processing enhances **data privacy**.

---

## Limitations & Things to Keep in Mind
- The analysis is **hypothetical** and based on broad assumptions; it does not track actual historical fund returns.
- May rely on high‑level market/sector data rather than detailed fund‑by‑fund holdings.
- Not a substitute for professional financial advice.
- Ensure you use a secure device and back up exported data; browser storage can be cleared.

If you’re a mutual‑fund investor seeking more control beyond “set the SIP and forget”, MFTracker is a compelling tool. It offers structural insights, risk profiling, and smart rebalancing—all without requiring sign‑up.
